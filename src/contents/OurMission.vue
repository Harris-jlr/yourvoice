          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-900">
            Blue Line Design is a collective of developers, designers, and strategists reshaping the way digital work gets done.
            We're not an agency — we're a team of collaborators who believe that clean code, fair practices, and shared ownership lead to better outcomes.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-blue-900 mt-6">
            Our platform supports developers with real project opportunities, transparent processes, and a community that values quality, clarity, and care.
            For clients, we offer honest delivery, scalable solutions, and teams that are invested in the work — because we built this to work for everyone.
